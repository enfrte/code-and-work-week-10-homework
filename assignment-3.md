# ASSIGNMENT 3: Student registry database

Let's continue ASSIGNMENT 4: Student registry from the Lecture 9. 

Create a student database and connect to it through Mongoose.

Make sure that every endpoint updates the actual database if there is a new student, deleted student or updated student.

Also, make sure to actually retrieve the data from the database when it's needed.
